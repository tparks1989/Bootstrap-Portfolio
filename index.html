        <p>
          My name is Tyrone Parks and I am a team leader at Freedom Mortgage
          Corporation. Freedom mortgage is a top ten mortgage lender in the
          country. I currently assist with the operations end of the mortgage
          industry which includes processing loans, and I also can assist with
          the closing portion of the loan. I am currently enrolled in a coding
          boot camp at the University of Pennsylvania. Once I complete the boot
          camp I will be exploring a new journey in life. My goal is to become a
          full stack web developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am the father of a beautiful princess, and a husband to a lovely
          wife. They are my motivation to accomplish my goal and push me to be
          the best man I can be. We are looking to expand our family which this
          coding boot camp will open the door to new opportunities for my
          family. In my spare time I like to spend time with my girls. I also
          enjoy sports, exercising, video games, and fashion. Additionally I am
          what you would call a "sneaker head" which means I buy and collect a
          lot of sneakers.
